# graph-project
This website is a learning tool designed to help students practice and understand basic graph transformations in algebra. It allows users to visualize and interact with common parent functions and their transformations, making abstract mathematical concepts more accessible.

Features
Interactive Graphs: Modify graph parameters to see real-time transformations.
Parent Functions: Includes common functions such as:
Linear (y = x)
Quadratic (y = x^2)
Absolute Value (y = |x|)
Exponential (y = a^x)
Others relevant to basic algebra courses.

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the website.
CSS: For styling and ensuring an intuitive layout.
JavaScript: For interactive graph rendering and dynamic parameter adjustments.
[Graphing Library/Tool]: Plotly.js

How It Works
Select a parent function from the menu.
Adjust the transformation parameters using input sliders or text boxes.
Observe the graph update in real-time to reflect the changes.
Experiment with different transformations to deepen your understanding of the concepts.

Future Plans
Add support for more advanced functions (e.g., trigonometric, logarithmic).
Introduce a quiz mode for practicing transformations.
Include detailed explanations of each transformation effect.
Allow users to save and share their custom graphs.
